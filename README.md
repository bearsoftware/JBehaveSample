JBehaveSample
=============

Basic JBehave Example - 2 Different Runner Styles &amp; Simple Story

*Prerequisites*

*Features*

1. Junit style story runner - features junit step creation and nicer view in junit panel.
2. An annontated story runner - mainly just to experiment, I prefer the Junit one.
3. Both can be run as a junit test in Eclipse.
4. Sample & Steps story based on the JBehave Trader example on http://jbehave.org/reference/latest/index.html
5. The Trader Stock service is partialy implemented, 1 test passes, 1 fails.
6. Reports for the Junit runner are created in {project root}/jbehave and the other runner creates them in {project root}/target/jbehave/
7. I have added 'style' and 'images' to give nice looking reports.
